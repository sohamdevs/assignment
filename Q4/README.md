    - Create a Filter component to filter tasks

2. <b>State Management</b>:
    - Use the useState and useEffect hooks for state management
    - Use local storage to persist the tasks

3. <b>Functionality</b>:
    - Add a new task with text input
    - Mark a task as complete/incomplete by clicking on it
    - Delete a task
    - Filter tasks by all, completed and pending
    - Persist tasks in local storage
